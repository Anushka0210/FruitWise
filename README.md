## Introduction
The fruit recognition system is developed to automatically classify and identify various types of fruits from input images. It utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze the visual features of fruits and make predictions. The system can be useful in various applications such as inventory management, quality control, and agricultural research.

## Installation
To use the fruit recognition system, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fruit-recognition.git
   ```
   
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download or prepare your own dataset (see [Dataset](#dataset) section).

## Usage
Once the repository is cloned and the dependencies are installed, follow these steps to use the fruit recognition system:

1. Prepare your dataset by following the instructions in the [Dataset](#dataset) section.

2. Train the model using the provided dataset or your own dataset (see [Model Training](#model-training) section).

3. Evaluate the trained model's performance (see [Evaluation](#evaluation) section).

4. Use the trained model to classify new images or integrate it into your own applications.

## Dataset
The dataset used to train and evaluate the fruit recognition system is not included in this repository due to its size. However, you can use your own dataset by following these guidelines:

1. Organize your dataset into separate directories, with each directory representing a specific fruit class.

2. Each fruit class directory should contain images of that particular fruit only.

3. Ensure that the images are in a common format such as JPEG or PNG.

4. Split your dataset into training and testing sets, and place them in separate directories.

5. Update the data paths in the code accordingly.

## Model Training
To train the fruit recognition model, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have prepared the dataset as described in the [Dataset](#dataset) section.

2. Run the training script:
   ```
   python train.py
   ```

3. The script will train the model using the provided dataset or your own dataset. It will save the trained model weights for future use.

4. Experiment with different hyperparameters and architectures to improve the model's performance.

## Evaluation
To evaluate the trained fruit recognition model, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have trained the model using the [Model Training](#model-training) section.

2. Run the evaluation script:
   ```
   python evaluate.py
   ```

3. The script will load the trained model and evaluate its performance on the testing dataset.

4. It will generate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
